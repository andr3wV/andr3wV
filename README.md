### ðŸ‘‹Hey, I'm Andrew 

I'm a senior at the University of Notre Dame studying Computer Science and Economics. My goal is to make scalable and robust software.

I feel I have a solid foundation in application engineering, and I'm currently interested in learning more about artificial intelligence, entrepreneurship/startups, and applications of finance in CS. In my free time, I work on smaller projects, travel, and play soccer!

Check out [my website](https://www.andrewvittiglio.com) where I will post about myself and my projects!
